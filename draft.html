    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Erlyn Joy Zapra, 20 years old, born on January 4, 2005. I dream of becoming a Certified Public Accountant one day,a goal I’m working hard to achieve. Pink has always been my favorite color; it just makes everything feel a little brighter. Music plays a big part in my life, and I love listening to Taylor Swift, ABBA, and Coldplay. Some of my favorite songs are “Daylight,” “Dancing Queen,” and “The Scientist.” During my free time, you’ll usually find me listening to music, cooking, or catching up on sleep. One series I really enjoyed is When Life Gives You Tangerines it’s not just entertaining, but also packed with real-life lessons that stick with you long after watching. Above all, my favorite Bible verse, Romans 8:28, reminds me that everything happens for a reason: “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.” It's a constant reminder to trust the process and keep the faith.
